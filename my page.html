<h3>1) Reformation: Baker Street Is Purple</h3>
<h4>Synopsis:</h4>

        <p>
            <h5>Standing at 110,000 words.</h5>
            
            The bildungsroman, Reformation: Baker Street Is Purple, follows the convoluted life of Isla Red, a talented runner with an enhanced mind everyone around her strives to get a glimpse into. Raised by her father – a religious zealot – to fulfil a prophecy he abides by, Isla is tested by an organisation of neurologists unbeknownst to him. Completing physically and mentally gruelling tasks leave Isla on the brink of death. Forced to battle her reality alone for years, her only reward: a coloured watch gifted by scientist, Dr Abbey. The clock face is a mechanical spy, documenting her every heartbeat and conversation. With each scientific visit, the colour is switched to represent her levels throughout the medical programme Isla is unaware she stars in. The question: who is watching? Dr Abbey is tasked with monitoring Isla’s progress, all the while his son, Jack, is slowly falling in love with her through a screen. Jack grows up watching and admiring her resilience and his voyeurism comes full circle when they meet face-to-face in their late teens. But it’s at 11 when her life changes. Headmaster Nottingham offers her a place at one of London’s most prestigious private schools where she meets Incy – a troubled young girl – and  forms a witty reputation and life-long bond with her English teacher Mr Blu Fredrickson. He discovers how Isla’s own mind plagues her, and fights against Isla’s violent refusal for her to come to terms with her unique past. Mr Fredrickson’s obsession with Isla leads to the disregard of Incy. As Mr Fredrickson and Isla remain ignorant of the espionage that haunts her, Mr Nottingham evolves into an orchestrator, covering up the dirty work of the corporation that exploits Isla Red. The Headmaster turns a blind eye to the suffering of his prized student, allowing corruption to fester within the school's community. Shocked by the lack of social responsibility Britain's education has to offer, Mr Fredrickson – an Oxford graduate – takes matters into his own hands and follows Isla’s story which conveniently slips through London’s crippling regulations as he relentlessly pursues her truth. With Isla Red in denial of her past and Mr Fredrickon gob-smacked with this arrogant, ethereal girl, the two push and pull neglecting the well-being of each other and those around them which ultimately leads to Incy’s expected yet tragic death. As the duo combat love, pain and abuse, they realise they need each other to survive and quickly tie up their loose ends resulting in Isla finding freedom and Mr Fredrickson, the daughter he never knew he needed. The pair’s bond is tested by societal pressure, suspicion and each other. After a trip to Cambridge Isla falls in love and realises she must leave the educational institution she thought she thrived in as well as the one she never consented to being in. Isla moves on with her life, leaving Mr Blu Fredrickson alone, with only a dead friend and bloody novel to remember her life by.

Also, why did it randomly start on an aeroplane after a middle aged man hears a Beatles song? This felt cheap, perhaps more true to real life, as these things do happen. Mundane collides with nostalgia. This was probably Marukami’s goal, which he obviously achieved, it doesn't mean i approve of the goal though. It ruins the complexity of his novel, which looking back on it, probably wasn't that complex.

It should have ended in pain or pure bliss, not a mundane atmosphere, but the movie ending is just perfect thanks to Guadagnino.</strong>

The moral: there is something larger than life lurking in space time.

Once the protagonist learns Maxim never loved his ex-wife Rebecca, and murdered her instead, her worries of their future together, and if her love was unrequited disappear.The protagonist sheds her innocence.  She does not condemn him for the murder, and neither did I when I read the book. I wanted him to get away with his crime. Men are easily forgiven, whilst women are not. When Rebecca was revealed to be a vile wife, I loathed her. But when I learnt Maxim murdered her, I respected him. This shows us the shocking double standards within society even today, Du Maurier’s excellent characters and maybe even me.

                                Duckworth explored Talent vs Effort or ‘Grit.’ She frequently used the term ‘Grit paragon’ stating people who are ‘Grit paragons’ are statistically proven to succeed. She conducted some of her studies at Westpoint (the American equivalent of Sandhurst.) Overall, she found that those with a growth mindset and consistent effort, beat those with ‘natural talents.’ She found that those with natural talents and a ‘high grit score’ were exemplary in their area of choice. This book was motivating and taught me that consistent effort beat natural skill when applied.

                            <td><strong>I didn’t like Chbosky’s writing style, yet it was perfect for the first person protagonist, Charlie. Charlie falls in love with senior Sam, and to be honest after reading the novel I don't quite know why. When she interacts with him it seems more motherly than anything else. Their push and pull dynamic doesn't work either because Charlie never engages in it, he only thinks it. Sam addresses this saying “It's really sweet and everything, but you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. I don't want to be somebody's crush. I want people to like the real me.” This to me did not ring true as people said it did on Reddit. I just make fun of Reddit users now. It was not ‘visceral’ for her to say this. She knew Charlie loved her and actively told him to stop. She then says it's ‘sweet’ to be his crush, which is reductive as Charlie admits he was truly in love with her when she and Craig broke up. He isn't relieved or happy he is sad, because she is sad. That is raw love and she calls it a ‘sweet crush.’ Sam didn’t deserve charlie. The character of Mr Anderson was an interesting one. He pushes Charlie according to his academic ability and serves as the mentor Charlie needed throughout the book. A short one, only 230 pages. The words were a little larger too. The part about his Aunt Helen is spot on. The way he still loves the women who did abuse him, and how he doesn't really address or recognise the abuse is more true to life. Parts of the book felt underwhelming, and the epistolary aspect made no sense to me. He addressed each letter with ‘Dear Friend’ and ended with ‘Love always, Charlie.’ This made me think it was the audience he was writing to: ‘Dear Friend’ but then at the end it suggested he mailed them randomly . I don't know. I thought it was unnecessary ad would have been more ‘full-circle’ if he was sending these letters to his friend Michael who died of suicide.

                            <td>Theo Decker is an interesting character as well as his best friend Boris. I think that the whole novel as a Bildungsroman worked really well. Some might consider his journey through the sandy terrain of West America as boring but I thought it was true to life. Each character is well fleshed out, even Theo’s dad who is nothing like him. Boris definitely brings an element of violence into the book and one could say their friendship was Theo’s ultimate downfall, after all, it was Boris who introduced him to drugs and drink. Perhaps without the negative influence, Teo would have been okay. Conversely, Boris kept Theo gping when he was isolated in a new town surrounded by new people. The remote location of his Dads house compared with NewYork with his mum was nice to see. The whole alienated teen thing worked well in this book. I wasn't bored either, but perhaps I should have been. I doubt this is due to the plot because there wasn't really one, other than the epic twist at the end: Boris had sold the real painting years ago and Theo had been renting out that storage unit for nothing. Theo’s descent into the criminal world was also fuelled by his obsession with this painting. But it was never really about the painting I don't think, it was that the painting represents mother, Hobie, Blackwell, New York, Kitsy, Mrs Barbour. He was desperate to keep that connection and hold onto that painting. He never wanted to sell it for money , so why keep it then? Boris is to blame for Theo’s descent into chaos and crime, and Theo’s lonely circumstances and tragic childhood fuelled this further. Boris–the russian–was a perfect companion for Theo. He brought out his reckless side allowing him to survive. Critics say the Goldfinch suffocates under its sheer weight, but I think that's what makes it impressive. The choice to make this a long Bildungsroman was worth it. I felt accomplished at the end of reading it because it was a brick, and I also believed I had learnt something. What more could you ask for? There was no logical reason for Theo’s love for Pippa to be unrequited. She understood what he went through as she was there. Pippa was everything Kitsy wasnt and Theo should have ended up with her, but true to life she didn't. The novel does invoke ‘Dickens’ but without the myriad of characters. This could provide evidence for the popular theory that the Goldfinch 'suffocates under the sheer weight of its pages.’ I do not hold this view; I think that this novel has a place in society.

                            <td><strong>Brilliant novel. The unreliable narrator I dont think was as unreliable as everyone thought. He did idolise the Classics students Henry, Carles, Bunny, Camilla and Franics but other than that… Julian Morrow was someone I expected more from. The summary at the back of the book implies he was a murderer or something, but ultimately all he does is sort of, not necessarily condone the group's murder of Bunny, nor does he cover it up, he just does nothing which is worse. Whether he was involved with previous bacchanals or not I don't know, I think it was implied he taught Henry how to go about them. All I know is his charm and wit was felt at the beginning a little too intensely then fizzled out as the rest of the group became more interesting.

                            <td>Half of a Yellow Sun, Chimmamanda Ngozi Adichie</td>
                            <td>Follows the formation of Biafra. This book was surprisingly easy to follow despite many characters. My favourite parts of the novel: Ugwu’s development into a young educated man. His devotion and fierce loyalty as well as ability to mingle with Jomo and Harrison (gardener and steward for Richard). He remains neutral in their squabbles, a clever thing to do. This won me over. His dedication to his master as well as Olanna thickens as the novel progresses. Although always respectful, he gains more agency to do things within the household and how he speaks to his employers. By the time he is conscripted, Ugwu is thought of more as a son. His actions during the war (including a rape) startled me. I thought his character was stronger than that, and I could only really start to sympathise once he expressed deep regret and shame. Perhaps this shows how war circumstances make readers (including myself) more tolerant of evil behaviours. War after all is plagued with starvation, preying upon the vulnerable, and death.

                                Kainene, Richard and Madu was an interesting one. Kainene and Richard’s relationship I believe to be stronger than Olanna and Odenigbo. Richard is tempted once by Olanna, and isn't truly in love with her like many of her other admirers. He finds her attractive and she almost manipulates him out of rage and desperation caused by Odenigbo impregnating his mother’s village-girl, Amala. Olanna is shown to be virtuous throughout the novel and even adopts this child as her own. Not once is Olanna angry at Amala. Kainene burns Richard;s manuscript as punishment, and I was more surprised with how well he took it. He simply allowed it and was even hopeful as he says it meant she was willing to move on. Richard and Kainene were two of my favourite characters. Kainene’s fierce nature was more interesting than Olanna’s nobility. 
                                
                                The novel in question: The world was silent when we died. Throughout Half of a Yellow sun, Adichies mentions a male writing, and we all assume it to be Richard as he works on three manuscripts throughout the novel. Ultimately, after the first is buried, the second burned and the third given up on Richard comes to the conclusion it was never his story to tell. This was a shock to me as Richard had spent the entire novel trying to assume his identity as a Biafran. He didn't like those that pointed out it was not really his battle to fight. After trying to prove to the audience he was truly Biafran for so long, he eventually accepts he is and will always be English. He was not dogmatic in his assumption of identity, he merely wanted to love something he could not understand as much as he thought. This was amazing.
                                
                                Ugwu turns out to be the one writing the novel (who’s title was suggested by Madu). The dedication page is brilliant. The whole novel comes full circle in the most satisfying way. Ugwu also earns his place as the central character observing the world laid out in front of him. The other characters ultimately act as foils for him.
